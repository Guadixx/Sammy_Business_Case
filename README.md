# Sammy Business Case 

## What is the project about?
This is a Single Page Application (SPA) designed to display a list of items. Each item includes relevant information such as its price, and interactive features like "Like" and "Share" buttons. The app allows users to easily browse through the items, like their favorites, and share them with others. It is built with a focus on simplicity and a smooth user experience.

## Things I would like to improve
- One of the things I would have liked to implement is Material UI (MUI) for faster and more consistent UI component styling. However, I decided against it because I wanted to stay as faithful as possible to the original design in the Figma link, and I was concerned that using MUI could have made it more difficult to perfectly match the design details.
- Another thing I would have liked to implement is the use of conventional commits throughout the project. This would have allowed me to demonstrate my ability to follow consistent, structured commit messages, which are essential in professional environments
- Currently, the "Share" button is quite basic and only provides limited sharing capabilities. In the future, I would like to enhance this feature by integrating more advanced sharing options, such as the ability to directly share items to popular social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp. This would provide users with a more seamless and user-friendly experience, allowing them to easily share their favorite items with their networks.
- Thereâ€™s always room for improving the code structure. Refactoring certain parts to follow best practices more strictly (e.g., modularizing components, enhancing reusability, and improving naming conventions) could make the codebase more maintainable.
